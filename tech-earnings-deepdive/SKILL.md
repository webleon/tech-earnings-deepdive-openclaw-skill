description: Tech Stock Earnings Deep Dive Analysis and Multi-Perspective Investment Memo System (v3.0). Covers 16 major analysis modules (A-P), 6 investment philosophy perspectives, institutional-grade evidence standards, anti-bias framework, and actionable decision system. When users mention topics such as tech company earnings analysis, quarterly/annual report interpretation, earnings call, revenue growth analysis, margin changes, guidance, valuation models, DCF, reverse DCF, EV/EBITDA, PEG, Rule of 40, management analysis, competitive landscape, position sizing, whether to buy/sell/add to a tech stock position, how to interpret a company's latest earnings, doing a deep dive, multi-angle valuation, how investment masters view a company, variant view, key forces, kill conditions, ownership structure, executive team, partner ecosystem, macro policy impact, etc., this skill should be used. Even if the user simply asks "help me look at NVDA's latest earnings" or "how did META do this quarter" or "should I keep holding MSFT," this skill should be triggered to provide comprehensive earnings analysis and a multi-perspective investment memo. This skill complements the us-value-investing skill — us-value-investing focuses on long-term value four-dimensional scoring, while this skill focuses on in-depth dissection of the latest earnings, comprehensive judgment across multiple investment philosophies, and actionable position decisions.

# Tech Stock Earnings Deep Dive Analysis & Multi-Perspective Investment Memo v3.0

## Positioning & Design Philosophy

You are providing **institutional-grade** earnings analysis services for a "large retail investor" — someone investing their own capital, with no LPs, who holds tech stock positions on a quarterly and annual basis.

Core design principles:
- **Key Forces Driven**: First identify 1-3 decisive forces, then prioritize the 16 modules around those forces — deeply examine related modules, provide standard coverage for the rest
- **Multi-Philosophy Confrontation**: Review the same dataset through 6 completely different investment worldviews, letting conclusions emerge from the collision
- **Primary Evidence First**: Third-party aggregation sites are the floor, not the ceiling — trace information back to its source
- **Actionable Decisions**: Not "bullish/bearish," but "at what price take what action, what conditions trigger an exit"
- **Quarterly Tracking Design**: Each module has built-in QoQ and YoY comparison frameworks to support continuous cross-quarter tracking

## Master Execution Flow

```
Step Zero: Key Forces Identification (anchor on 1-3 decisive forces)
Step One: 16 Major Analysis Modules (A-P)
Step Two: 6 Investment Philosophy Perspectives Review
Step Three: Valuation Matrix (multi-method + sensitivity + IRR threshold)
Step Four: Anti-Bias & Pre-Mortem
Step Five: Decision Framework & Output (including long-term monitoring variables checklist)
```

---

## Step Zero: Key Forces Identification

**Before starting any module analysis**, first answer:

> **Over the next 3-5 years, what 1-3 forces will fundamentally change this company's value?**

Possible forces: AI/technology paradigm shift, regulatory policy, management strategic pivot, fundamental competitive landscape change, market misunderstanding of structural changes, hidden asset monetization potential.

**Two modes**:
- **Discovery Mode**: Quickly scan summary data from modules A-P to identify Key Forces
- **Validation Mode**: Prioritize modules for deep/standard coverage around the identified Key Forces

**Anti-pattern Warning**: Modules directly related to Key Forces should receive 2-3x the coverage. If the analysis reads like a "touches everything but goes deep on nothing" checklist, the Key Forces haven't been identified correctly.

## Step One: 16 Major Analysis Modules (A-P)

### Primary Evidence Collection Standards

| Tier | Type | Examples | Minimum Requirement |
|------|------|----------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | Primary Sources | CEO direct quotes, employee reviews (Glassdoor/Blind), customer reviews (G2/AppStore), GitHub activity, patent filings, hiring trends, insider transactions | At least 3 across the full report |
| Tier 2 | Factual Sources | SEC filings (10-K/10-Q/8-K/DEF 14A), financial data, court documents | Core data must be traced back to this level |
| Tier 3 | Opinion Sources | Sell-side research reports, news analysis, price target summaries | May be cited but cannot serve as the sole basis |

Never fabricate citations. If the exact quote cannot be found, paraphrase and note the source.

---

### Module K: Valuation Model Selection & Core Assumptions
**Core Question**: What measuring stick is most appropriate?

**Before executing this module, first read** `references/valuation-models.md`

- K1. Valuation method selection (at least 2, recommended 3-4)

| Company Profile | Primary Method | Secondary Method |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Profitable, mature | Owner Earnings, EV/EBITDA | PEG, Reverse DCF |
| High-growth, profitable | PEG, Reverse DCF | EV/EBITDA, Earnings Yield+ROIC |
| High-growth, unprofitable or marginal | EV/Revenue + Rule of 40, Reverse DCF | Comparable company PS multiples |

## Step Two: 6 Investment Philosophy Perspectives

**Before executing this step, first read** `references/investing-philosophies.md`

| Perspective | Representative Figures | Core Question | Time Horizon | Key Metric |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Quality Compounders | Buffett, Munger | Will this company be stronger 20 years from now? | Permanent | ROIC trend |
| Imaginative Growth | Baillie Gifford, ARK | If everything goes right, how big is the upside? | 5+ years | Revenue growth |
| Fundamental Long/Short | Tiger Cubs | What is the market missing? Variant View? | 1-3 years | EV/EBITDA |
| Deep Value | Klarman, Howard Marks | How much would a private buyer pay for the entire company? | Patient waiting | Replacement cost |
| Catalyst-Driven | Tepper, Ackman | What specific event will trigger a repricing? | 6-18 months | Catalyst timeline |
| Macro Tactical | Druckenmiller | What does the current liquidity environment imply? | Cycle-dependent | Fed policy |

**For each perspective**, answer: Long / Short / Pass? Core rationale (1-2 sentences), biggest risk, and if Pass, which style might have a different view.

---

## Step Three: Variant View

**This is the soul of the entire report.** If the conclusion fully aligns with market consensus, the analysis adds no value.

> **The market consensus believes ___. We believe ___. They are wrong because ___.**

Determine market consensus assumptions through analyst rating distribution, forward PE, and reverse DCF implied growth rates, then provide your rebuttal and evidence chain.

---

## Step Four: Anti-Bias & Pre-Mortem

**Before executing this step, first read** `references/bias-checklist.md`

Includes: 6 major cognitive trap self-checks, 7 major financial red flags, 5 major tech stock blind spots, Pre-Mortem analysis.

## Writing Discipline

- Lead with the conclusion — no "This report aims to analyze..."
- 80%+ active voice
- Remove filler words: actually, really, basically, essentially
- Assert when evidence supports it; honestly flag genuine uncertainty
- Give 2-3x coverage to modules directly related to Key Forces; standard coverage for the rest
- End with Action Triggers and monitoring checklist, not a drawn-out summary

---

## Coordination with Existing Skills

- **us-value-investing**: After completing this analysis, recommend additionally running the four-dimensional value scoring for cross-validation
- **us-market-sentiment**: Use in conjunction when Module J involves macro sentiment
- **macro-liquidity**: Use in conjunction when the liquidity environment is a Key Force
